# capitalismExperiment
A repository for experiments to be done with friends, on profiting from the legal and social support systems available for Capitalism in India, perhaps with some changes from the usual ways of doing things. 

Step 1.  
Become a director of a private limited company. Who can become a director? Any one. Revenue stream for government and security benefits to employees who work under the leadership of the directors?

The DIN form DIN-3 (one mentioned at above link) is found to be too confusing, it asks for Corporate Identity Number of the Company to be mandatorily provided. Which begs the question - what comes first, registering the company or its first directors?

http://www.bioincubator-iitm.in/company.pdf gives a better idea of the procedure, not sure how recent this document is.

Here is another link that is found the most useful so far: https://www.indianweb2.com/2013/07/12/how-to-register-a-companystartup-in-india/  
This one clearly talks about DIN-1 form and provides the download link. This form seems to be relevant for directors of new companies, not sure why MCA website does not properly mention this at the mca site page given previously.
