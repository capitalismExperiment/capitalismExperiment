# capitalismExperiment
A repository for experiments to be done with friends, on profiting from the legal and social support systems available for Capitalism in India, perhaps with some changes from the usual ways of doing things.

The DIN form is found to be too confusing, it asks for Corporate Identity Number of the Company to be mandatorily provided. Which begs the question - what comes first, registering the company or its first directors?
