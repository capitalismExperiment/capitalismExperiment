# capitalismExperiment
A repository for experiments to be done with friends, on profiting from the legal and social support systems available for Capitalism in India, perhaps with some changes from the usual ways of doing things. 

Auto-generated website is at https://capitalismExperiment.github.io/capitalismExperiment/

Aim of Experiment: 
- In the business world, top of the pecking order seem to be the directors + majority shareholders of corporations such as limited liability companies. The risks are there for this reward. Aim is to try out and quantify the risk and if possible, reap the rewards. Else in non-entreprenuer mode, industry appears to struggle to utilize all categories of potential employees and still follows antiquated management policies that may not benefit the economy (leave aside meeting basic CSR goals). 

Step 1.  
Become a director of a private limited company. Who can become a director? Any one. Revenue stream for government and security benefits to employees who work under the leadership of the directors?

The DIN form DIN-3 (one mentioned at above link) is found to be too confusing, it asks for Corporate Identity Number of the Company to be mandatorily provided. Which begs the question - what comes first, registering the company or its first directors?

http://www.bioincubator-iitm.in/company.pdf gives a better idea of the procedure, not sure how recent this document is.

Here is another link that is found the most useful so far: https://www.indianweb2.com/2013/07/12/how-to-register-a-companystartup-in-india/  
This one clearly talks about DIN-1 form and provides the download link. This form seems to be relevant for directors of new companies, not sure why MCA website does not properly mention this at the mca site page given previously.

Ultimately we go in for a third party who claims that they make around Rs. 999 out Rs. 10274 where the rest goes to govt. and CAs. They do all the needed activities within 5-8 working days. We are supposed to be given a complete breakup of the cost and there are are supposed to be no hidden charges. Accordingly, document gathering and discussion with this third party registration facilitation company, are in progress.
